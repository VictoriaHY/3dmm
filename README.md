## Capstone Project

Our goal is to utilize RGB-D video from selfie camera to reconstruct 3D digital human heads.

This part of code is to utilize 3DMM to reconstruct human heads.

We utilize both face and ear key points as well as depth to supervise our 3D head.

We hardcode the path for video, keypoints and depth in our code. You can directly edit them.

You can try:

```
python depth_fit_fw.py
```

to run on the data.

Please refer to ear branch for more details.
